You are helping me build a Real-Time File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) system as a capstone project.

Project description

Goal: Design a real-time FIM system that:

Watches critical directories in real time

Builds a secure baseline of file hashes

Logs all changes with precise timestamps and context

Highlights:

what changed

when it changed

why it matters from a security perspective

Respects governance:

avoid monitoring personal data when configured

protect log integrity (tamper-evident logging)

Provides:

simple alerting

attacker / system activity timeline

concise documentation on deploy, usage, and interpreting output

Hackathon MVP must support:

Monitor ONE directory

Detect create/modify/delete

Log timestamps

Final Project MVP must support:

Full agent (configurable, long-running)

Hash engine and baseline of files

Attacker timeline view

SIEM-friendly alerts/logs
